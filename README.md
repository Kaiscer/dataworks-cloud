At the network layer, the resources required to establish a virtual network in the cloud are defined. This includes the creation of a virtual network, subnets, security groups, load balancers and firewall rules. Terraform allows you to define network configurations declaratively, which facilitates the creation and administration of the network infrastructure.

At the application layer, you define the resources needed to run and scale applications. This can include virtual machine instances, containers, application services, storage systems, performance monitors, and so on. Terraform allows you to define and configure these resources, specifying details such as instance type, size, security settings and network connectivity.

At the database layer, resources for storing and managing data are defined. This can include relational databases, NoSQL databases, file storage services, and so on. Terraform can be used to create and configure these resources, setting options such as database type, capacity, redundancy and backup policies.

In addition to defining the resources, Terraform allows you to manage the dependencies and relationships between them. For example, rules can be set for application instances to connect to the corresponding databases and for load balancers to direct traffic to the appropriate instances. Terraform also facilitates scalability, allowing resources to be duplicated or removed as needed.
